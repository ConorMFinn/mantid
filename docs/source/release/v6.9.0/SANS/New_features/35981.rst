- The :ref:`algm-SANSTubeCalibration` algorithm now takes a filepath to optionally save out the list of calibrated tubes that exceed the cvalue threshold. Additionally, the cvalues workspace in the Workspaces list is now suffixed with the detector name. The algorithm has also been changed to allow a directory to be specified for saving the integrated input workspaces, rather than simply saving to the user's default Mantid save directory.
