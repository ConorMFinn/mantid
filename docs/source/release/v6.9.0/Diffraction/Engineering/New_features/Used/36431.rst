- The MaskWorkspace parameter of the Mantid algorithms :ref:`GetDetectorOffsets <algm-GetDetectorOffsets>` and :ref:`PDCalibration <algm-PDCalibration>` is now an optional output workspace.  This parameter will only be output when assigned a name in the keyword-arguments list.  In the case that a mask workspace of this name already exists, its incoming masked values (1.0 => dead pixel, 0.0 => live pixel) will be combined with those of any failing pixels identified during an algorithm's execution.  For :ref:`PDCalibration <algm-PDCalibration>`, the MaskWorkspace parameter also has a new position in the LHS output-workspace ordering, and now appears one-prior to the diagnostic workspaces in this list.
