- Add support for a radial collimator in :ref:`DiscusMultipleScatteringCorrection <algm-DiscusMultipleScatteringCorrection-v1>` algorithm that restricts scatter points within a small region within the larger sample volume. The algorithm was modified to assign zero weight to tracks where the final scatter is not in a position that allows the final track segment to pass through the collimator toward detectors.
