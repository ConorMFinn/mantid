- :ref:`algm-Load` will now give a warning if the extension specified on the filename, eg. `MUSR15189.txt`, is not found.
  Loading files from interfaces or other algorithms should also give this warning.
  The algorithm will still load the file by looking for other extensions, as was the case before.
