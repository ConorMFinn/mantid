- SaveNXSPE now stores the run number of the input workspace in the instrument section.

  For Indirect instrument it also saves efixed taken from detector's crystal analyzer properties.
  If all crystal analyzers have the same energy, single efixed is written
  into NXSPE_info->fixed_energy as before, while if detectors have different analyzer's energies, array of the energies is written
  into NXSPE_info->fixed_energy field of nxspe file.
  Also for Indirect instrument, no "fermi" field is added to the "instrument" folder.

  The algorithm have also modified so if Ei is provided as the propery value, it always overrides the values, retrieved from workspace.
