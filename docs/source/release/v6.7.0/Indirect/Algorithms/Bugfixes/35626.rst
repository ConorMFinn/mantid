- The weighting of quantum orders in Abins and Abins2D has been
  corrected. The previous behaviour led to:
  - underestimation of orders 3+ (generally comprising the "phonon
    wing") when using autoconvolution with QuantumOrderEvents=2
  - exaggeration of order 2 (but with correct orders 3+) when using
    autoconvolution with QuantumOrderEvents=1

  With this bugfix in place the magnitude of order 2 is very similar whether
  calculated analytically or by convolution.
