- Fixed bug in absolute unit normalisation in ISIS powder reduction where the vanadium workspace shape was used instead of the sample.
- Raise errors in absolute normalisation due to lack of sample/vanadium shape and material in ISIS powder reduction
- Raise an error in POLARIS (ISIS) powder reduction script if user tries to creta a vanadium workspace without correcting for absorption and multiple scattering.
- Exposed ``MSEvents` parameter of :ref:`MayersSampleCorrection <algm-MayersSampleCorrection>` to users of ISIS powder reduction scripts (parameter ``mayers_mult_scat_events`` in the instrument settings).
