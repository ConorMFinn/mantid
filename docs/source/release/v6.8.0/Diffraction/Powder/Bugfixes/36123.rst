- Fixed way `FitPeaks` uses workspace indices in "PeakCentersWorkspace" and "FitPeakWindowWorkspace", to correspond to the same spectrum workspace indices in the input workspace, even when using "StartWorkspaceIndex" and "StopWorkspaceIndex".  This fixes the issue with `PDCalibration`.
- Fixed bug in `FitPeaks` which assumed the zeroeth workspace index defined the largest number of peaks to attempt to fit in all spectra.
