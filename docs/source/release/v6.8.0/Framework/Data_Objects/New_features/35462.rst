- `GenerateGroupingPowder` was edited to allow for optional saving as a nexus file, and for different labeling methods.  To save as nexus file, set the property "FileFormat" to either `nxs` or `nx5`.  To distinguish left/right sides of instrument, set the property "AzimuthalStep" to a number other than 360.  To label groups in order, as opposed to by their angular position, set the property "NumberByAngle" to false.
