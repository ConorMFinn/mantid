- :ref:`ConvertDiffCal <algm-ConvertDiffCal>` and :ref:`CalculateDIFC <algm-CalculateDIFC>` now have the option to specify Offset Mode, by selecting `Signed` you can calculate the offset for logarithmically binned data.  Also `Rebin <algm-Rebin>` now has an optional parameter to explicitly set binning mode (linear/log) regardless of binwidth sign.
