Abins will now delegate parsing of CASTEP .phonon files to the Euphonic library if available. (Euphonic is included by default for Windows packages and Conda builds.) This should give more robust handling of data files containing Gamma-points with LO-TO splitting; currently the Abins parser skips past other q-points to find these points, leading to an unpredictable loss of information. [Note that these problematic .phonon files are rare; typically CASTEP will include these points at the top, as assumed by the current behaviour. So far the problem was observed in data generated with a separate interpolation tool.]
