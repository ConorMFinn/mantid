- Remove unwanted interaction between Abins and Abins2D

  - Abins algorithm sets the value
    ``abins.parameters.sampling["bin_width"]`` while running. This
    would override the default sampling of Abins2D instruments if set.

  - This would not cause results to be incorrect, but would sample
    them on a different mesh to the expected one and could limit
    resolution.

  - The value is now saved and restored after use by Abins; it can
    still be modified by users who wish to fiddle with the Abins2D
    behaviour.
