- Abins and Abins2D now support JSON file import. Supported formats are:

  - AbinsData (dump of internal object, intended for development and testing)
  - euphonic.QpointPhononModes (an equivalent set of data dumped from
    the Euphonic library)
  - euphonic.ForceConstants (force constants which may be manipulated
    in Euphonic, and will be converted to phonon modes on a q-point
    mesh when Abins(2D) is run)

  The Euphonic JSON formats are convenient to create with Python
  scripts, and recommended for users who wish to somehow customise or
  manipulate their data before using it with Abins(2D).
