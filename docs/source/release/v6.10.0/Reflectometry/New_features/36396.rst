- Algorithm :ref:`algm-SaveISISReflectometryORSO` is now able to save multiple datasets to a single file. Note that as part of this change the InputWorkspace parameter has been renamed to WorkspaceList and takes a comma separated list of workspace names. Existing scripts that call the algorithm will need to be updated to use this new parameter name. The :ref:`Save ASCII tab<refl_save_ascii>` has been updated with additional checkbox options to support this new functionality when saving in the ORSO format.
