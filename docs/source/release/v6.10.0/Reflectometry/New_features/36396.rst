- Algorithm :ref:`algm-SaveISISReflectometryORSO` is now able to save multiple datasets to a single file. Note that as part of this change the InputWorkspace parameter has been renamed to WorkspaceList and takes a comma separated list of workspace names. Existing scripts that call the algorithm will need to be updated to use this new parameter name.
